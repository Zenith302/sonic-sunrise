# sonic-sunrise
Sonic Sunrise is a 3D fangame made by I and my friends out of our love and passion for Sonic The Hedgehog.

No copyright infringement is intended, and we obviously do not own Sonic The Hedgehog himself, or any part of his franchise. We have no affiliation with SEGA. This game should never be sold, and instead should be distributed for free.
